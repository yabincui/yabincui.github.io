<h1>Motivation<h1>
I have several computers, phone and tablet. I want to make plan or keep a note
at any time on any device, and be able to access them on any device. And I want
to be given some notifications of what I have to do today. I want someone to
take care of what I plan to do, what I have done, and give my a summary like
once a week. Unfortunately, currently there is no easy way to do so.
So I want to implement it by myself.

<h1>Design<h1>
To provide the web service, I plan to use google app engine to provide the
STORE/GET/CHECK_UPDATE services. On each devices, like linux/mac/windows/android,
I plan to write native apps to make it convenient to use. I will provide
access interface at google cloud.

<h1>Implementation</h1>
